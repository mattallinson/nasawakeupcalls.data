Project declared "cool" by NASA Astronaut and Max-Q lead singer 
[Tracy Caldwell Dyson](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/tracy-caldwell-dyson) 
in telephone interview 12 Feb 2020.

Data extracts and analysis from the NASA wake-up call project. This is a remix
project. Credit for the source material goes to Colin Fries of the NASA 
historical division, and is released as Public Domain by NASA. 

## Process and Requirements

When there is an opportunity I will walk people back through the process and
requirements too. I started but as the process of converting the data from
PDF to JSON continued it became more and more difficult - it was not
straightforward.

I will also list the tools and the order to run them.
I will follow up!

### Discogs genre tools
The cleaning tools made by Matt in the ipython notebook are commented, but of 
less general use, and also hideous. More information on the discogs API, and 
how to get an API token can be found here https://www.discogs.com/developers

## Questions without answers

I have questions I want to meditate on:

* Has the process been lossless?
* Has the source material been diluted?
* Is the transformative nature of this work worth it?
* It was expensive, how expensive was it?
* How would these costs compare to those in my subject discipline of
  digital-preservation?
* Does this work fit in the digital-humanities?
* Is it sustainable?
* Would I do it again??? (Yes, but after a holiday!)

## What next?

* Playlists! And greater access to the data.
* I want to find more tools to explore the data with.
	* Visdata looks great! http://visidata.org/
* I will start to edit the data using source control as a way of managing those
  edits.
* Keeping this list on-going â€“ Boe-OFT (20 december 2019) had "wake up music" 
  played to the crash-test dummy on the morning of the second day. 
  Caldwell-Dyson confirmed to Matt in interview that NASA plans to resume 
  wakeup music once US manned missions resume.
