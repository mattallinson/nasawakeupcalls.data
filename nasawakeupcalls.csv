One has Sinatra relaying the news to Jones while he was on holiday in Marbella. An alternative telling of the story, the cutest I can find, is from the New York Times published November 18, 1990, by Diane K. Shah: ""MY NAME IS DR. ALDRIN,"" THE man said. He had come up to Jones at a party in Sun Valley, Idaho, two, three years ago, a distinguished looking man in a white military jacket covered with medals. ""We worked together before,"" he added, ""but we'll talk about it later."" Mystified, Jones asked someone who the man was. ""Why that's Buzz Aldrin,"" came the reply. Later, the astronaut came up to Jones again. He said that just as he was getting ready to step off the spacecraft, he reached back and took the cassette of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" that Jones had arranged and conducted for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra, and he played it. ""The first music played on the moon,"" Jones says. ""I freaked."" ...The astronauts since Apollo 7 were equipped with a Sony TC-50 casette player for recording mission logs, but they also took mix-tapes with them to space. Fly Me to the Moon may very well have been the first human music played from an extraterrestrial surface."

The wake-up call for landing day was John Denver's version of the Steve Goodman  song, The City of New Orleans, with its chorus of Good morning, America, how are ya? It was a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up."

At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume...  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time. From Apollo Lunar Surface Journal"

It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time.
