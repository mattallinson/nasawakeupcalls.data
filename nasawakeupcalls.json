One has Sinatra relaying the news to Jones while he was on holiday in Marbella. An alternative telling of the story, the cutest I can find, is from the New York Times published November 18, 1990, by Diane K. Shah: \"MY NAME IS DR. ALDRIN,\" THE man said. He had come up to Jones at a party in Sun Valley, Idaho, two, three years ago, a distinguished looking man in a white military jacket covered with medals. \"We worked together before,\" he added, \"but we'll talk about it later.\" Mystified, Jones asked someone who the man was. \"Why that's Buzz Aldrin,\" came the reply. Later, the astronaut came up to Jones again. He said that just as he was getting ready to step off the spacecraft, he reached back and took the cassette of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" that Jones had arranged and conducted for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra, and he played it. \"The first music played on the moon,\" Jones says. I freaked.\" ...The astronauts since Apollo 7 were equipped with a Sony TC-50 casette player for recording mission logs, but they also took mix-tapes with them to space. Fly Me to the Moon may very well have been the first human music played from an extraterrestrial surface.\"",

At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume...  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time. From Apollo Lunar Surface Journal",

You should have started doing that on about day 2, Conrad quipped. And the crew down here couldn't find a song for three bulls, it was only one, replied CAPCOM. Conrad countered with, Here's a little old song, love. And then PAO filled in the background: That last song coming down from Skylab was out of Pete Conrad's repertoire of country-western music he has aboard. From Mission Commentary SL-II MC-1305/2.

It's splashdown, and Crip, you could both use a shower, said one member of the radio team. You've waited for this for 12 years and if you don't wake up you're going to miss the whole darn thing. Crip, said one voice, get out of the rack. No, no, no, said the other. If he wakes up he'll spill coffee all over the controls. Get to work, you guys. You've got 300 government agencies out there to support. Then Mission Control came back on the line. Now hear this, now hear this, reveille, reveille, up all idlers. And that last wakeup call, we'd like you to scratch out 'splashdown' and insert 'touchdown,' said Mission Control.",

Groundhog Day's I Got You Babe is a recurring theme for wakeup calls on missions which have been extended an additional two days, with the astronauts having to repeat their deorbit activities each day only to be told that because of bad weather they're going to go through the same tasks again the next day. For commander Ken Cockrell this was his third mission in a row where he's stayed in orbit for an additional two days in the hopes of good weather in Florida. On STS-80 the landing finally cooperated and he landed in Florida, for STS-98 and STS-111 he landed at the alternate site in California. PC",

Good morning Miss Joanie and to everyone down there in mission control. It's great to hear your voice this morning, Lockhart replied. Walking on sunshine? I think that's what John (Herrington) and Mike (Lopez-Alegria) are going to be doing for several hours today...  I'd like to say thank you to my wife and my daughters for thinking about me the last few days and I'm looking forward to seeing them too. PC",

The Jeopardy theme music was a running gag between Mike Lopez-Alegria and the Capcoms where he would pose various questions about the mission's status as quizzes. At one point the Capcom answered one of L-A's queries, and he replied But you forgot to phrase it in the form of a question. The evening before when MCC said goodnight a Capcom cautioned the wakeup music may sound familiar. Wetherbee replied How will we know? (a reference to the repeating cycle in the movie Groundhog Day.

Good morning, Houston and thanks Alvin, that's one of my favorite songs from church, Foreman said. That was awesome, and how appropriate for this special day. It sounds just as good up here as it does down there. Happy Easter. Drew wished the rest of Endeavour's astronauts a Happy Easter as well, though they were busy at the time. They're probably searching for their eggs, Foreman said.",

Responding to the wake-up call from Houston, he delivered the news that his wife Rebecca had given birth, saying good morning, Houston. Good morning, Rebecca, good morning, Wyatt, and good morning to our little girl. I just wanted to take this opportunity to report some good news, he said later in the morning. At 11:04 last night, Abigail Bresnik joined the NASA family and momma and baby are doing very well. I'm very thankful for everyone ... that's been so supportive and so helpful the last couple of days with everything that's been going on. The shuttle crew's wakeup music, chosen by Bresnik's wife, was a song titled Butterfly Kisses, which starts off with the lyrics: There's two things I know for sure: She was sent here from heaven and she's daddy's little girl.",

The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery's crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before. It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before.",

It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened live from Mission Control, Houston. That was terrific, Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest. Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It's very inspirational to the arts as well.",

Gabrielle Giffords helped start the first full work day in space for her husband and the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour with the song. It's the same song Giffords sent as a wake-up call to Mark Kelly in 2006 when they were just dating. But this time the message-of-hope lyrics seemed to have a special meaning given her recovery from being shot in the head Jan. 8 in Arizona. This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. It's good to be waking up in space again, Kelly radioed back to Earth. I want to thank Gabby, Claudia and Claire for that great wake up song. It's always good to hear U2 and 'Beautiful Day' in space.",

Rocket Man debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. Rocket Man also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades.",
