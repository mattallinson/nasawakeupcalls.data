At 700a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume...  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time. From Apollo Lunar Surface Journal",

Groundhog Day's I Got You Babe is a recurring theme for wakeup calls on missions which have been extended an additional two days, with the astronauts having to repeat their deorbit activities each day only to be told that because of bad weather they're going to go through the same tasks again the next day. For commander Ken Cockrell this was his third mission in a row where he's stayed in orbit for an additional two days in the hopes of good weather in Florida. On STS-80 the landing finally cooperated and he landed in Florida, for STS-98 and STS-111 he landed at the alternate site in California. PC",

I'm very thankful for everyone ... that's been so supportive and so helpful the last couple of days with everything that's been going on.

Rocket Man debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. Rocket Man also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades.",
