At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume...  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time. From Apollo Lunar Surface Journal",

        "INTRO": "This particular mission set a record for the number of different countries where people were born, Precourt, Collins, and Lu in the United States, Kondakova in Russia, Clervoy in France (representing ESA), and Foale in England and Noreiga in Peru. Of course, Foale and Noriega are both naturalized U.S. citizens and didn't represent their birth countries. Hence the large number of national anthems. PC",

Good morning Miss Joanie and to everyone down there in mission control. It's great to hear your voice this morning, Lockhart replied. Walking on sunshine? I think that's what John (Herrington) and Mike (Lopez-Alegria) are going to be doing for several hours today...  I'd like to say thank you to my wife and my daughters for thinking about me the last few days and I'm looking forward to seeing them too. PC",

As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before. It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time.

It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened live from Mission Control, Houston. That was terrific, Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest. Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more.

This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. It's good to be waking up in space again, Kelly radioed back to Earth.

Rocket Man debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. Rocket Man also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades.",
