COMMENT: ("Good Morning, America" line in song refers to Command Module, America. The wake-up call for landing day was John Denver's version of the Steve Goodman  song, "The City of New Orleans," with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It was a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up.

COMMENT: wake-up to Schmitt on Moon. "Jack Schmitt and Gordon Fullerton were both undergraduates at the California Institute of  Technology. At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume..."  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. "In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time." From "Apollo Lunar Surface Journal"

COMMENT: Short excerpt from an old Spike Jones record followed by a comic tape with voices of Houston DJs Hudson and Harrigan kidding Young and Crippen, then  "Reveille". "It's splashdown, and Crip, you could both use a shower," said one member of the radio team. "You've waited for this for 12 years and if you don't wake up you're going to miss the whole darn thing." "Crip," said one voice, "get out of the rack." "No, no, no," said the other. "If he wakes up he'll spill coffee all over the controls." "Get to work, you guys. You've got 300 government agencies out there to support." Then Mission Control came back on the line. "Now hear this, now hear this, reveille, reveille, up all idlers. And that last wakeup call, we'd like you to scratch out 'splashdown' and insert 'touchdown,'" said Mission Control.

COMMENT: "Good morning, and thanks for the magnificent music from the magnificent crew at Houston," Atlantis pilot Eileen Collins said after Houston mission control congratulated the crew again for the near flawless start to their 10-day trip.
INTRO: This particular mission set a record for the number of different countries where people were born, Precourt, Collins, and Lu in the United States, Kondakova in Russia, Clervoy in France (representing ESA), and Foale in England and Noreiga in Peru. Of course, Foale and Noriega are both naturalized U.S. citizens and didn't represent their birth countries. Hence the large number of national anthems. PC

COMMENT: Clips from the movie "Groundhog Day" ("I Got You Babe") and the television game show" "Jeopardy" The "Groundhog Day" was a reference to the multiple landing attempts. At this point STS-113 tied the previous record of two additional extensions waiting for good weather. With the additional day beyond that, they set a new record for the number of landing tries. The Jeopardy theme music was a running gag between Mike Lopez-Alegria and the Capcoms where he would pose various questions about the mission's status as quizzes. At one point the Capcom answered one of L-A's queries, and he replied "But you forgot to phrase it in the form of a question." The evening before when MCC said goodnight a Capcom cautioned "the wakeup music may sound familiar." Wetherbee replied "How will we know?"

The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery's crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: "Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before." It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before.

ARTIST: Big Head Todd and the Monsters
COMMENT: The song was performed live by Todd Park Mohr, vocalist and lead guitarist of the band, accompanied by fellow band mates Brian Nevin, Rob Squires and Jeremy Lawton. The song received the most votes in NASA's Top 40 song contest receiving 722,662 votes (29 percent of the 2,463,774 total). It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened "live" from Mission Control, Houston. "That was terrific," Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. "We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest." Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery "and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It's very inspirational to the arts as well."

SONG: "Beautiful Day" performed
ARTIST: U2
COMMENT: The song was played for Commander Mark Kelly. Wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords helped start the first full work day in space for her husband and the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour with the song. It's the same song Giffords sent as a wake-up call to Mark Kelly in 2006 when they were just dating. But this time the message-of-hope lyrics seemed to have a special meaning given her recovery from being shot in the head Jan. 8 in Arizona. This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. "It's good to be waking up in space again," Kelly radioed back to Earth. "I want to thank Gabby, Claudia and Claire for that great wake up song. It's always good to hear U2 and 'Beautiful Day' in space."

SONG: Rocket Man
ARTIST: Elton John
COMMENT: Flight Day 6 was kick-started for the STS-135 astronauts with a special wake-up message from Elton John and one of the legendary performer's greatest hits. "Rocket Man" debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. "Rocket Man" also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: "Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades."

"Good morning, Atlantis," he said. "This is Michael Stipe from R.E.M. We wish you much success on your mission, and thank all the women and men at NASA who have worked on shuttle for three decades. From Earth, a very good morning to you."

"Good morning Atlantis, from your friends at Stennis Space Center," Stennis employees said. "It's time to fire up your engines - laissez les bons temps rouler!"
