-----
12/11/72		04 07 05 01 - 04 07 11 04  (TEC) (12/11/72)"City of  New Orleans" by John Denver  COMMENT: ("Good Morning, America" line in song refers to Command Module, America. The wake-up call for landing day was John Denver's version of the Steve Goodman  song, "The City of New Orleans," with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It was a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up.
-----
12/12/72		05 14 15 05 (TEC) (12/12/72)"Ride of the Valkyries" by Wagner 			COMMENT: wake-up to Schmitt on Moon. "Jack Schmitt and Gordon Fullerton were both undergraduates at the California Institute of  Technology. At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume..."  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. "In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time." From "Apollo Lunar Surface Journal"
-----

6/21/73  Boatswain's Call and "Lonely Bull" by Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass 		COMMENT: The boatswain's pipe was directed to Pete Conrad by Paul Hand, probably because Conrad was Navy. "You should have started doing that on about day 2," Conrad quipped. "And the crew down here couldn't find a song for three bulls, it was only one," replied Capcom.Conrad countered with, "Here's a little old song, love." And then PAO filled in the background: "That last song coming down from Skylab was out of Pete Conrad's repertoire of country-western music he has aboard."

4/14/81           n/a by n/a            COMMENT: Short excerpt from an old Spike Jones record followed by a comic tape with voices of Houston DJs Hudson and Harrigan kidding Young and Crippen, then  "Reveille". "It's splashdown, and Crip, you could both use a shower," said one member of the radio team. "You've waited for this for 12 years and if you don't wake up you're going to miss the whole darn thing." "Crip," said one voice, "get out of the rack." "No, no, no," said the other. "If he wakes up he'll spill coffee all over the controls." "Get to work, you guys. You've got 300 government agencies out there to support." Then Mission Control came back on the line. "Now hear this, now hear this, reveille, reveille, up all idlers. And that last wakeup call, we'd like you to scratch out 'splashdown' and insert 'touchdown,'" said Mission Control.

DID NOT ACHIEVE ORBIT
-----
ADDITIONAL: Challenger's primary and secondary 'O-rings' failed during lift-off. The O-rings were developed by NASA's rocket scientists to create a seal between the outside layers of the rocket and its fuel. With this seal failing, super-heated rocket-fuel escaped from the rocket and as ground-control radioed "throttle-up Challenger" the spaceship would explode and the shuttle and its crew were doomed. Space Shuttle Challenger did not achieve orbit on January 28 1986. The lives of those on-board challenger would not be forgotten.

"Groundhog Day's "I Got You Babe" is a recurring theme for wakeup calls on missions which have been extended an additional two days, with the astronauts having to repeat their deorbit activities each day only to be told that because of bad weather they're going to go through the same tasks again the next day. For commander Ken Cockrell this was his third mission in a row where he's stayed in orbit for an additional two days in the hopes of good weather in Florida. On STS-80 the landing finally cooperated and he landed in Florida, for STS-98 and STS-111 he landed at the alternate site in California. PC

3/7/2011                      The "Theme from Star Trek," performed by Alexander Courage 		COMMENT: served as the wake up music for Discovery's crew at 2:23 a.m. It received the second most public votes from a Top 40 list in a Space Shuttle Program-sponsored song contest (671,134 votes (27 percent of the total). The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery's crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: "Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before." It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before.

The song received the most votes in NASA's Top 40 song contest receiving 722,662 votes (29 percent of the 2,463,774 total). It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened "live" from Mission Control, Houston. "That was terrific," Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. "We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest." Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery "and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It's very inspirational to the arts as well."

5/16/2011                     "Beautiful Day" performed by U2 		COMMENT: The song was played for Commander Mark Kelly. Wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords helped start the first full work day in space for her husband and the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour with the song. It's the same song Giffords sent as a wake-up call to Mark Kelly in 2006 when they were just dating. But this time the message-of-hope lyrics seemed to have a special meaning given her recovery from being shot in the head Jan. 8 in Arizona. This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. "It's good to be waking up in space again," Kelly radioed back to Earth. "I want to thank Gabby, Claudia and Claire for that great wake up song. It's always good to hear U2 and 'Beautiful Day' in space."

7/13/2011		Rocket Man by Elton John 		COMMENT: Flight Day 6 was kick-started for the STS-135 astronauts with a special wake-up message from Elton John and one of the legendary performer's greatest hits. "Rocket Man" debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. "Rocket Man" also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: "Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades."

7/14/2011		Man on the Moon by R.E.M. 		COMMENT: Michael Stipe front man for R.E.M. started  the crew's day with an A capella version of the group's hit, "Man on the Moon". On recording this song for the Atlantis' last crew Stipe said, "I recorded 'Man on The Moon' for NASA in Venice, Italy, where Galileo first presented to the Venetian government his eight-power telescope, and in 1610 wrote 'The Starry Messenger' (Sidereus Nuncius), an account of his early astronomical discoveries that altered forever our view of our place in the universe." "Good morning, Atlantis," he said. "This is Michael Stipe from R.E.M. We wish you much success on your mission, and thank all the women and men at NASA who have worked on shuttle for three decades. From Earth, a very good morning to you."
-----

Beyonce brought it on orbit when "Girls" was played for the entire crew as a tribute to the final shuttle mission and also to women in space: "Good morning Atlantis, this is Beyonce. Sandy, Chris, Doug and Rex, you inspire all of us to dare to live our dreams, to know that we're smart enough and strong enough to achieve them. This song is especially for my girl, Sandy, and and all the women who've taken us to space with them and the girls who are our future explorers." http://www.archive.org/details/STS-134

"Good morning Atlantis, from your friends at Stennis Space Center," Stennis employees said. "It's time to fire up your engines - laissez les bons temps rouler!" "Laissez les bons temps rouler," is a Cajun French phrase that translates "Let the good times roll." was in good working order before it was installed.

-----
7/21/2011		"God Bless America" by Kate Smith		COMMENT: Kate Smith's rendition of Irving Berlin's "God Bless America" woke Commander Chris Ferguson, Pilot Doug Hurley and Mission Specialists Sandy Magnus and Rex Walheim. But unlike most wakeup songs, which are played in honor of a particular crew member, this one was dedicated to all the men and women who have worked for the Space Shuttle Program in the past three decades... "the men and women who put their heart and soul into the shuttle program for all these years," as Capcom Shannon Lucid told the crew. Ferguson said it was an appropriate song for their last day in space.
