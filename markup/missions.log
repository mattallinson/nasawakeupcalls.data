The wake-up call for landing day was John Denver's version of the Steve Goodman  song, "The City of New Orleans," with its chorus of "Good morning, America, how are ya?" It was a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up.
-----
12/12/72		05 14 15 05 (TEC) (12/12/72)"Ride of the Valkyries" by Wagner wake-up to Schmitt on Moon. "Jack Schmitt and Gordon Fullerton were both undergraduates at the California Institute of  Technology. At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume..."  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. "In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time." From "Apollo Lunar Surface Journal"
-----
12/13/72		06 13 45 04  (TEC) (12/13/72) "Texas Aggie Fight Song" to lunar crew. Honors Flight Director's Gerry Griffin's  alma mater, Texas A & M.

-----
6/21/73  Boatswain's Call and "Lonely Bull" by Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass. The boatswain's pipe was directed to Pete Conrad by Paul Hand, probably because Conrad was Navy. "You should have started doing that on about day 2," Conrad quipped. "And the crew down here couldn't find a song for three bulls, it was only one," replied Capcom.Conrad countered with, "Here's a little old song, love." And then PAO filled in the background: "That last song coming down from Skylab was out of Pete Conrad's repertoire of country-western music he has aboard."

"It's splashdown, and Crip, you could both use a shower," said one member of the radio team. "You've waited for this for 12 years and if you don't wake up you're going to miss the whole darn thing." "Crip," said one voice, "get out of the rack." "No, no, no," said the other. "If he wakes up he'll spill coffee all over the controls." "Get to work, you guys. You've got 300 government agencies out there to support." Then Mission Control came back on the line. "Now hear this, now hear this, reveille, reveille, up all idlers. And that last wakeup call, we'd like you to scratch out 'splashdown' and insert 'touchdown,'" said Mission Control.

9/30/88                       Robin Williams opened with  "Gooooooood Morning Discovery!!!" in "Good Morning Vietnam" style. The original recording produced by Houston area DJ from KKBQ, Mike Cahill, also included original lyrics recorded to the theme music of the TV show "Green Acres". Robin Williams was approached by Cahill about doing the tape. NASA knew nothing of the tape until it was offered as a gift by Cahill. Mike Cahill, writer, producer for KKBQ Radio, Houston and a part-time on-call tour guide at JSC, said he had listened to some wake-up calls a year and a half ago and some of them were, "You know, kind of awful. So what I did was thought gee it would be nice to write, produce and custom design songs for the astronauts. I picked three tunes that were pretty catchy, that were very short and upbeat. Green Acres was the first one. I thought gosh that would be the last thing they'll expect to hear." Pat Mattingly, who works in Mission Control, found out Cahill was doing them and said they were looking for new stuff. She gave a tape to CAPCOM Kathy Sullivan. Mike wrote the lyrics in early 1987. Threw in Discovery because knew it would be next Orbiter to fly. He collaborated with Mark Richardson, the leader of a band named "Eclipse." Mike and Mark worked on putting the music together. Richardson played keyboard, guitars, drum machine. Mike called on Patrick Brennan who used to be with now-defunct group "Popkorn" that played in clubs around Clear Lake to do the vocals. Mike and Mark helped out on the chorus for Green Acres. Green Acres was Mike's favorite. "It was as dopey and stupid and corny as I had hoped it would be." He said he wanted to show that NASA people have a sense of humor. "It's the closest I'll ever get to going to space." From JSC Query Book

-----
3/7/2011                      The "Theme from Star Trek," performed by Alexander Courage, served as the wake up music for Discovery's crew at 2:23 a.m. It received the second most public votes from a Top 40 list in a Space Shuttle Program-sponsored song contest (671,134 votes (27 percent of the total). The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery's crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: "Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before." It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before.
-----

It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened "live" from Mission Control, Houston. "That was terrific," Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. "We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest." Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery "and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It's very inspirational to the arts as well."

5/16/2011                     "Beautiful Day" performed by U2. The song was played for Commander Mark Kelly. Wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords helped start the first full work day in space for her husband and the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour with the song. It's the same song Giffords sent as a wake-up call to Mark Kelly in 2006 when they were just dating. But this time the message-of-hope lyrics seemed to have a special meaning given her recovery from being shot in the head Jan. 8 in Arizona. This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. "It's good to be waking up in space again," Kelly radioed back to Earth. "I want to thank Gabby, Claudia and Claire for that great wake up song. It's always good to hear U2 and 'Beautiful Day' in space."
-----

"And I want to say that's a perfect way to start an exciting rendezvous day!"

7/13/2011                   Flight Day 6 was kick-started for the STS-135 astronauts with a special wake-up message from Elton John and one of the legendary performer's greatest hits. "Rocket Man" debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. "Rocket Man" also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: "Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades."
-----
7/14/2011                    Michael Stipe front man for R.E.M. started  the crew's day with an A capella version of the group's hit, "Man on the Moon". On recording this song for the Atlantis' last crew Stipe said, "I recorded 'Man on The Moon' for NASA in Venice, Italy, where Galileo first presented to the Venetian government his eight-power telescope, and in 1610 wrote 'The Starry Messenger' (Sidereus Nuncius), an account of his early astronomical discoveries that altered forever our view of our place in the universe." "Good morning, Atlantis," he said. "This is Michael Stipe from R.E.M. We wish you much success on your mission, and thank all the women and men at NASA who have worked on shuttle for three decades. From Earth, a very good morning to you."
-----
7/15/2011                    Sir Paul McCartney greeted the Atlantis crew with the Beatles favorite "Good Day Sunshine". "Good morning guys, wake up! And good luck on this, your last mission. Well done," McCartney said in a message recorded pre-launch for the final space shuttle crew.
-----
7/16/2011                    "Run the World (Girls)" After being awakened by a special greeting from songstress Beyonce Knowles.

Beyonce brought it on orbit when "Girls" was played for the entire crew as a tribute to the final shuttle mission and also to women in space: "Good morning Atlantis, this is Beyonce. Sandy, Chris, Doug and Rex, you inspire all of us to dare to live our dreams, to know that we're smart enough and strong enough to achieve them. This song is especially for my girl, Sandy, and and all the women who've taken us to space with them and the girls who are our future explorers." http://www.archive.org/details/STS-134
-----
7/17/2011                     "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang, played for Mission Specialist Sandy Magnus. The song was accompanied by a special good morning message recorded by employees at NASA's Stennis Space Center in southern Mississippi, the NASA center that is home to the test stands that verified each of the main engines that helped propel space shuttles into low Earth orbit, including the three used in the STS-135 launch. "Good morning Atlantis, from your friends at Stennis Space Center," Stennis employees said. "It's time to fire up your engines - laissez les bons temps rouler!" "Laissez les bons temps rouler," is a Cajun French phrase that translates "Let the good times roll." was in good working order before it was installed.
-----
7/18/2011                    "Days Go By" by Keith Urban, which was played for Mission Specialist Rex Walheim. The song was accompanied by a special good morning message recorded by employees at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. The NASA center is home not only to the astronaut corps, but also Mission Control and the Space Shuttle Program. "Good morning, Atlantis, from all of us at the Johnson Space Center!" chorused an auditorium-full of Johnson employees in a message recorded before Atlantis' launch. "Have a great mission!"
-----
7/19/2011                    "Don't Panic" by Coldplay, which was played for Pilot Doug Hurley. This was the last wakeup song played for a shuttle crew while docked to the International Space Station. Coldplay's "Viva la Vida" was the wakeup music for the crew on Flight Day 2.

"Three ...two ... one ... Good morning, Atlantis!" the group said. "Kennedy salutes you. See you back at wheels stop!" Kennedy is home to the space shuttle fleet, along with its launch pads and the people who prepared the shuttles for each trip into space.
-----
7/21/2011                    Kate Smith's rendition of Irving Berlin's "God Bless America" woke Commander Chris Ferguson, Pilot Doug Hurley and Mission Specialists Sandy Magnus and Rex Walheim. But unlike most wakeup songs, which are played in honor of a particular crew member, this one was dedicated to all the men and women who have worked for the Space Shuttle Program in the past three decades... "the men and women who put their heart and soul into the shuttle program for all these years," as Capcom Shannon Lucid told the crew. Ferguson said it was an appropriate song for their last day in space.

Sol 4:    "The Final Frontier" Paul Reiser, Don Was (Theme from "Mad About You") The team sent their "wakeup call" to Mars as a joke (it's not like a spacecraft would need music) and the team enjoyed it enough that it became a tradition. The "Mad About You" production office was surprised by the choice and put out a press release noting the unusual use for their theme song. They even used a clip of the Mars team playing the music in the end credits of one of their shows. PC
