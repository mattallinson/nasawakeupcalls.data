[n] STS-51-L            January 28, 1986
[n] INTRO: DID NOT ACHIEVE ORBIT
[n] ADDITIONAL: Challenger's primary and secondary 'O-rings' failed during lift-off. The O-rings were developed by NASA's rocket scientists to create a seal between the outside layers of the rocket and its fuel. With this seal failing, super-heated rocket-fuel escaped from the rocket and as ground-control radioed "throttle-up Challenger" the spaceship would explode and the shuttle and its crew were doomed. Space Shuttle Challenger did not achieve orbit on January 28 1986. The lives of those on-board challenger would not be forgotten.
